# Alakajam8
My entry for the 8th Alakajam game jam. 

This time around, I wanted to try a different coordinate system. And I wondered why nobody uses triangles as a coordinate system. Now I know. :)

Have fun playing (https://www.thedreamweb.eu/game_host/Alakajam8). It's an unranked entry. There's no dying and no winning. Just diving. So go ahead and relax.
